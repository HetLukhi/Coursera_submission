# Wanderlust Explorer — Travel Recommendation Website

A simple, rubric-ready project that recommends destinations (Beaches, Temples, and by Country) with a clean UI, three pages, and vanilla JavaScript interactivity.

## Pages
- `index.html` — Home (intro + interactive recommendations)
- `about.html` — About Us (mission + team)
- `contact.html` — Contact Us (email form with validation)

## How to run locally
Open `index.html` in a browser. No build step is required.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Push this folder to a **public** GitHub repository.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, choose the `main` branch and `/root` folder.
3. Wait for Pages to publish. Your site will be at:  
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Notes
- Images are loaded from Unsplash via the `source.unsplash.com` endpoint with descriptive queries.
- The Home page initially shows **Beach** recommendations to satisfy the rubric’s image requirements.
